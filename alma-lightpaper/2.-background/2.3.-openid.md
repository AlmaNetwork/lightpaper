# 2.3. OpenID

OpenID Connect (OIDC) is a protocol for user authentication. It can be used for authentication by adding an identity layer to OAuth 2.0, the authorization protocol. OIDC is mainly used for usecases such as single sign-on and social login.

Nevertheless, OIDC has the following problems:

* **Centralization**: OIDC is extremely dependent on identity providers (IdPs). All end-user data are managed by the IdP, and operations such as authentication and obtaining profile information are dependent on them. Therefore, if IdP stops functioning for some trouble, all relying parties (RPs) will become dysfunctional.
* **Privacy Control**: In OIDC, users may not be able to control the data passed to RPs. If there is a lack of explanation as to what information is passed to the RP during the authentication process, end-users cannot learn how their information is used. In addition, if they are not given the opportunity to give explicit consent for the sharing of their data, they may pass unnecessary information to the RPs.
