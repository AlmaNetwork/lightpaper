# 2. Background

Today, the Internet has become indispensable for humanity. Countless devices are connected to the Internet, communicating with each other. Services on the Internet can provide products and services to users by assigning them IDs to identify them.

However, there are various problems with the systems surrounding IDs:

* There is a cost of guaranteeing compatibility between services due to the proliferation of proprietary ID standards.
* There is a risk that the data associated with IDs may be subject to changes inevitable for users. For example, an ID can be suspended by compulsion due to the circumstances of the ID providers or global conditions.
* Web services including blockchain solve the above issues to some extent, but they are not user-friendly because it is difficult for many users to manage their information, passwords, and private keys.

Naturally, there already exist projects which research and develop solutions for these problems. The following sections describe the characteristics and challenges of such projects.
