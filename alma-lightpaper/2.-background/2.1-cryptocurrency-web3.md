Blockchain is a degital ledger technology which organizes data into a series of blocks and store them in a distributed manner. Each block, which contains a number of transactions and a hash value of the previous block, is linked together like a chain and distributed by nodes, making it difficult to falsify. Since a wide variety of assets, from currency such as Bitcoin and Ethereum to complex program, can be managed on a blockchain, the blockchain is developing as an industry today.

However, blockchain has some issues regarding identity management.

* **Privacy**: Since blockchain is basically an architecture that manages all transactions publicly, it is necessary to add cryptographic function and external storage function to manage personal information in a way that protects privacy.
* **Key Management**: Many blockchains use public key cryptography, and authentication is performed with a private key. Therefore, if the private key is lost, access rights and assets are lost.
* **Scalability**: Blockchain stores large amount of data, which brings about issues with improving performance.
