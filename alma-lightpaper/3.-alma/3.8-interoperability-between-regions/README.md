# 3.8 Interoperability between Regions

The act of acquiring instance data associated with a given ID is called "resolution". Basically, it is possible to resolve between connected regions since the information of the regions (e.g., the endpoints) are mutually recognized.

We propose a resolution method that makes it possible to query to a region for an ID or associated information inside another region. It is necessary to know where to accress after connecting other region.
