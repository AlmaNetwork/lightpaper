# 3.3.1 Technology Stack

<figure><img src="../../../.gitbook/assets/無題01 - フレーム 7.jpg" alt=""><figcaption><p>Figure 1: Technology stack of ALMA.</p></figcaption></figure>

Figure 1 shows the technology stack of ALMA and elemental technologies in each layer. The roles of each layer are described as follows:

* Layer 1: **Basic storage layer**. It manages data encryption and storing method, etc.
* Layer 2: **Peer-to-peer connection layer**. It manages communication between ALMA nodes.
* Layer 3: **Entity layer**. It manages the business logic of ALMA (e.g., authority management and inter-region coupling, etc.).
* Layer 4: **Application ecosystem layer**. It manages user interface such as web front or mobile apps.

These layers are implemented using the technologies in Figure 1.
