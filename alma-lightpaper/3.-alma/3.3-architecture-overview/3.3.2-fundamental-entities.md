In ALMA, there are fundamental entities, i.e, identifier, schema, and instance. Data units called instances are passed between identities. The relationship between these entities are shown in Figure 2.

* **Identifier (ID)**: An identifier assigned uniquely in each region of ALMA. ID can be assigned to people, organization, and objects.
* **Schema**: A type definition of a set of data that is passed in a region of ALMA. IDs with schema definator role can define one.
* **Instance**: A data entity created by putting actual data into a schema. Instances are issued by a signer, owned by a holder, and verified by a verifier. Each of a signer, holder, and verifier has an ID.
