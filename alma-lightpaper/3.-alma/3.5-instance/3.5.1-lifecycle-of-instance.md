<figure><img src="../../../.gitbook/assets/Instance Lifecycle.jpg" alt="" width="563"><figcaption><p>Figure 6: Lifecycle of an instance.</p></figcaption></figure>

Figure 6 shows the lifecycle of an instance. The behavior and data flow of an instance are as follows:

* **Issuer** can issue an instance to a holder. The issuer and the holder may be identical.
* **Holder** can transfer an instance to other holder.
* **Holder** can delete an instance.
* **Holder** can present an instance to a verifier. The holder configures permissions such as expiration date and disclosing content extent.
* **Verifier** can request an instance to a holder.
* **Verifier** can verify the received instance. Specifically, it checks whether the schema, issuer, and holder, etc., are correct.

There are two disclosure methods: one is requested by the verifier and the other is disclosed by the holder.
