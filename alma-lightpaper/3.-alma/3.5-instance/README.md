# 3.5 Instance

In ALMA, an **instance** is a set of data passed between IDs, and is stored according to a schema. An instance is issued by a signer, owned by a holder, and verified by a verifier. All data associated with an ID is represented in an instance, and the disclosure authority, viewing range, etc. are associated with the instance.

Instance elements are flexible in who they disclose to and how they are disclosed.

* Full disclosure of elements
* Partial disclosure of elements (Selective Disclosure)
* Disclose only that the element meets the criteria (Zero Knowledge Proof)
