# 3.4 Identifier

An **identifier (ID)** is something identifiable that can be linked to properties (e.g., instances, permissions, etc.) in a region. Properties can be linked to one's own or someone else's ID. By linking permissions, it can control the behavior of the personality that is linked to ID.

ID can be assigned to any entities such as persons, groups, and physical objects. If the entity pointed to by an ID is a human being, or a program, etc., the entity may have the intention of expressing itself. On the other hand, if the entity is an object, etc., the ID is controlled by others, since the entity does not actively take action.

When a new user registers to a region, ID is issued by an issuer and assigned to the new user. If a region allows anyone to register, the new user may be identical to the ID issuer.
