# 3.4.2 Cryptographic Operation

In ALMA, cryptographic technique is used to verify that an entity is linked to the ID. To be specific, public key cryptography is used to verify that the command was executed by the correct entity.

* No one can manipulate the data of other IDs without permission in the system alone.
* If user lose the private key, it can be recovered in some way to its original state, or close to it.

In light of this, secure multi-party computation (MPC) scheme is used in managing keys. That is, the MPC protocol is executed to perform cryptographic operations such as authentication, signing, and encryption. The private key is distributed to multiple nodes securely and each node cannot specify the original key data. Even if one node in the region is compromised, the private key itself will not be compromised.
