# 3.4.3 Lifecycle of Identifier

When a new user is assigned an identifier (ID) in a region, the ID is issued by anyone. In a region that anyone can register to, the holder may be identical to the issuer.

The key to manipulate IDs can be securely recovered even if it is lost using secret sharing. For more information [3.4.2-cryptographic-operation.md](3.4.2-cryptographic-operation.md "mention")

ID deletion and deprecation is controlled by the region's permission management.
