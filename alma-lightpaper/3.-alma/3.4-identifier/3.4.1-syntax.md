# 3.4.1 Syntax

The syntax of an identifier in ALMA is described in the following ABNF notation:

```
id = any-name '@' region
region = any-name 1 * ( '.' region )   | "[" <IP> | <Network-Domain>"]"
any-name = 1*char
char = ALPHA / DIGIT / "-" / "_"
```

For example, `mizuki@tokyo` / `tea@chiyoda.tokyo` are valid IDs. When an ID is registered to a region, the ID become valid within the region. Idential IDs cannot exist in a single region, hence ID is unique.
