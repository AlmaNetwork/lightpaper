# 3.7.1 Roles

A role is a bundle of executable commands ( `AddUser` / `CreateSchema` ) defined within a region. ALMA uses role-based access control (RBAC), where all users belong to a specific group and their privileges are determined based on the roles associated with the group.

The division of authority is described in [3.7.4-authority-management](3.7.4-authority-management/ "mention")
