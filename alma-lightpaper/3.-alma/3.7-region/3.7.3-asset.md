# 3.7.3 Asset

Asset represents an asset within ALMA. Unlike instance, which is associated with an ID, asset has some characteristics as follows:

* Assets are traded between IDs.
* Assets are countable.
* The timestamp at which the assets are exchanged and asset amount at a given time are stored.

Assets such as currency and real estate are managed in a region. This will allow for penalties, welfare, and other incentives within the region, while also allowing for fundraising without the region.

The asset is tied to a user in a region, and can be exchanged. In addition, inter-region exchange is also possible.

The ALMA network allows each region to issue, manage, and distribute tokens and stable coins. The issued assets can be freely traded among the regions, and eventually various assets will be distributed throughout the network, realizing a system on the ALMA network that is wrapping the existing economic sphere.

Asset is also used as a method of exchanging credit between regions (see [3.8.2-trust-creation.md](../3.8-interoperability-between-regions/3.8.2-trust-creation.md "mention")).
