# 3.7.4 Authority Management

In this section, authority management in ALMA is explained. The goal is to make it possible to select an authority management model for each region and to apply the administrator's philosophy to authority management. ALMA addresses not only the registration management of ID and schema by general administrators, but also how the authority of the administrators can be restricted.
