# Separation of Powers

As an example of authority model in ALMA, there is one that refers to Montesquieu's "separation of power". In this model, administrator's role is separated into the following three things:

* Registering ID and adding ID to a role group
* Registering for a role group
* Revoking above actions

By separating in this way, a rampage of single administor can be stopped by other multiple administors, which act as a deterent. As a result, sound region management will be realized.
