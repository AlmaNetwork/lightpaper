# 3.7.2 Incentive Design

While general public decentralized systems have incentives, ALMA differs from them in that there are no common incentives for the network as a whole. However, we believe that incentives are essential for organizing regions. Therefore, each region can design its own incentives. For example, a region may define an incentive to operate a node as a participant of MPC, or not to take malicious actions such as spoofing or fake information.

Incentive is customizable. Combining incentives and other features of ALMA, it is possible to design incentives to control not only hobby groups, commercial organizations, local governments, but also gigantic and complex organization such as states.
