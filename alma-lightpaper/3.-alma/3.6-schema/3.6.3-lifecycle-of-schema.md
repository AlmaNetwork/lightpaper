Figure 7 shows the schema-centered lifecycle.

* **Definator** can define a schema and store it in a region.
* **Definator** can update a schema. A schema is managed by version so that even if the schema is updated, the schema data before updated remains as it is.
* **Definator** can derive a schema. Thatis, referring to an existing schema, and definator can define a new schema derived from it.
* **Definator** can deprecate a schema. A schema basically cannot be deleted, but can be deprecated in order not to recommend instance generation.
* **Verifier** can refer to a schema in a region for verifying instances.
* **Issuer** can refer to a schema in a region for issuing instances.
