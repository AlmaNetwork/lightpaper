# 3.6.2 Available Data Type

There are basically 4 data types that are available in a schema.

* `text`
* `int`
* `real`
* `boolean`

In addition to these, the same data as JSON can be used to support `list` and `object` as structural types.

For example:

```json
{
  "postal-code": "101-0005"
  "address": { 
    "prefecture": "Tokyo",
    "address": "Maruno-uchi"
  },
  "contry": "japan",
  "ã€€tags": ["postal", "energy"]
}
```
