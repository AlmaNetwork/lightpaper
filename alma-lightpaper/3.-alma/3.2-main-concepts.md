# 3.2 Main Concepts

ALMA is a software and also a protocol with features as follows:

* It provides an **identifier** entity, which is uniquely assigned to a person, an organization, or objects, etc.
* It provides a function to recover keys and data while guaranteeing self-sovereign by using secret sharing.
* It provides a data entity called **"instance"**, which has a selective disclosure function using zero knowledge proof.
* It provides a data format entity called **"schema"**, which has a registration function and a sharing function to unify data formats.
* It provides a network entity called **"region"**, where independency is guaranteed by defining and managing data, permissions, and users for each region.
* It provides an autonomous coupling function between regions. It combines loose and strong coupling, whether consortium or public, to address data loss and create trust.
