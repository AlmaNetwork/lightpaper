# 5.1 Public Key Cryptography

Public key cryptography is an encryption scheme in which a private key and a public key are used for encryption and decryption, respectively; from one private key, one public key can be derived, but conversely, it is practically difficult to derive a private key from a public key. This property can be used to prevent eavesdropping by a third party when sending and receiving data between two parties. The receiver discloses his/her public key to the sender, and the sender encrypts the data using the public key. The receiver receives the encrypted data and decrypts it with his/her private key. The private key and public key are also used for signature generation and verification, respectively, and to detect tampering.
