# 5.2 Multi-Party Computation (MPC)

MPC is a computing scheme that allows multiple nodes to cooperate in performing a computation. The input of each node is kept secret from other nodes, but the results of the computation are shared by all nodes participating in the computation. MPC also requires security to prevent attacks by nodes compromised by malicious adversaries.
