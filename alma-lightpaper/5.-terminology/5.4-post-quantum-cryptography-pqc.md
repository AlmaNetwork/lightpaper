# 5.4 Post Quantum Cryptography (PQC)

Quantum computers are expected to become a reality in 10 or 20 years, and must be kept in mind when ensuring security. It is necessary to assume that the public-key cryptography currently in use can be broken by a quantum computer in a realistic amount of time. The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) of the U.S. Department of Commerce is working on a project [to standardize quantum computer-resistant encryption algorithms (PQC)](https://csrc.nist.gov/projects/post-quantum-cryptography), and ALMA is closely monitoring this trend.
