# 4.2.2 Case where definator and signer are different

The presentation flow in [Section 4.2.1](4.2.1-case-where-definator-and-signer-are-the-same.md) has an issue that it is difficult to create a schema definition that meets commercial needs, resulting in inconvenience. Therefore we present a model that assumes that the definator and the signer are not identical.

**Registration Flow**

1. A company defines a schema that represents address in a form convenient for their business, and store it in a region.
2. A user with ID gets the schema and puts data into it to create an instance, which is then stored in the nodes in the region.
3. The municipality confirms the content (i.e., the user's address) of the instance and signs it if the address is acceptable.

Note that by assigning the data format to a private company and the content verification to a municipality, instances that guarantee convenience and correctness will be realized.
